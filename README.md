## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

This is my version of the Udacity Website Performance Optimization project, forked from [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio)

To get started, check out [this link](https://ohthatsteve.github.io/ud-optimize-project/).

### Getting started

####Part 1: Index.html overview

On the initial page load of `index.html`, you will be presented with a short description of myself as well as 4 links to pages generated by Udacity.
The last link, Cam's Pizzeria, will take you to `pizza.html`, where most of the magic happens. 

####Part 2: Pizza.html

This is a project page for a fake pizzeria.  This page features pizza images that move across the background, as well as pizza images that change sizes depending on the users size selection.  Both of these actions are done by javascript found in `views/js/main.js`.  This file had a few optimization issues that I have attempted to fix, and are outlined below.
